# My website about BAFH

The Bastard Assistant from Hell or BAfH for short is the character of the Bavarian university assistant Leisch from the stories by Florian Schiel.

The BAfH is based on the BOfH, the Bastard Operator from Hell, which was created earlier and enjoys cult status on the Internet and Usenet. In the satirical stories, Schiel describes the everyday life of a constantly ill-humoured assistant who neither likes students nor any form of work. In the short stories, Schiel therefore repeatedly describes the pranks and vulgarities that the BAfH inflicts on its environment. The BAfH also enjoys a certain cult status by now.

Besides the "Original BAfH" author, there are others, such as the BSfK (Bastard Student from Kiel, alias Hauke Goos-Habermann), who publish stories that take place in the BAfH universe.
